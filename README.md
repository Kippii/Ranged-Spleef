# Ranged-Spleef
Ranged Spleef allows you to play the normal average game of spleef, except you can now break blocks from a distance. What do I mean by from a distance? That means you can break blocks that are 200 blocks away. Yes, you heard me right. 200 blocks away! It doesn't matter how far away, but you are still able to break them. Not only that, but you can set a maximum distance that you can break blocks from and can set whether blocks drop or not. If you would like to do that, all you have to do it edit the config.yml. Here is the format:
```
ItemDrop: false
MaxDistance: 100
```
After doing that, you can set whether the items drop to true/false and you can set the maximum distance to any integer. I just set it to 100 for an example. This plugin has many possibilities and is really fun to mess around with friends with when you're bored. This is a cool and fun plugin that I recommend you play and test around with.
